# Biography

Welcome to my homepage! My name is Yinan Feng. I am now a Research Fellow at Zhejiang University, advised by Prof. [Shouling Ji](http://nesa.zju.edu.cn/webpage/crew/jsl.html).

I graduated from School of Electronics Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in June 2018, working with Prof. [Pan Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cTpFPJgAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am applying for Ph.D., and also actively looking for internship position for 2019. Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](file/resume.pdf).
